Welcome to the Spring Boot Deployment Project with GitHub, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS!

Overview:
In this project, we aim to deploy a basic Spring Boot application using modern DevOps tools and practices. The application's source code, Docker configuration, and build settings are managed in a GitHub repository. The deployment pipeline is orchestrated by Jenkins, leveraging Docker containers, Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and AWS services.
